									<p>Upon reflection I have found number of strengths and areas that still need work after evaluating my present work skill level in respect to the knowledge and abilities required for a career in software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI). First, I have great programming abilities with python and C++ which I have honed by attending programming lab and university course projects. I was able to learn how a program handle file for saving data and loading data from it. My team work skills have been refined through part time work and group projects in university, where my group successfully planed, designed a system for a company.</p>
									<p>There are several significant subjects I still need to work I need to work on. To stay up with the demands of the industry I need to expand my knowledge of advance ALI technologies like deep learning and neural networks which is now rudimentary. My data science ability needs a lot of improvement especially when it comes to analysing big datasets, these are essential for useful AI applications. I also donâ€™t have any formal training in AI ethics, which will become more significant as technology develops</p>
